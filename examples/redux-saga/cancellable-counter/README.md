# Cancellable Counter Example

This example extends [Redux Saga's cancellable counter example](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/tree/master/examples/cancellable-counter) to have multiple counters on the same page.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ioof-holdings/redux-dynostore.git

cd redux-subspace/examples/redux-saga/cancellable-counters
npm install
npm start
```
